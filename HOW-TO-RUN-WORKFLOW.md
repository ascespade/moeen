# 🚀 How to Run the Workflow

## Problem: Can't Run the Workflow

If you're having trouble running the workflow, here are the solutions:

## ✅ Solution 1: Fix Git Merge (Current Issue)

Your local changes need to be merged with remote changes. Run these commands:

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Complete the merge
git merge --no-edit

# Or if you want to accept all remote changes:
git checkout --theirs .github/workflows/cursor-continuous-fix.yml
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Resolve merge conflicts"

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

## ✅ Solution 2: Try Pull with Rebase

```bash
# Reset any pending merges
git merge --abort

# Pull with rebase
git pull --rebase origin main

# Push
git push origin main
```

## ✅ Solution 3: Start Fresh

If the above doesn't work:

```bash
# Stash current changes
git stash

# Pull latest
git pull origin main

# Pop changes back
git stash pop

# Resolve any conflicts manually
# Tent add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Update workflow files"

# Push
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 After Pushing, Trigger the Workflow

1. **Go to GitHub Actions**: 
   https://github.com/ascespade/moeen/actions

2. **Find the workflow**: "🔄 Cursor Continuous Fix & Enhance Loop"

3. **Click "Run workflow"** button (top right)

4. **Set parameters**:
   - Max attempts: 5 (default)
   - Stop on success: ✅ true

5. **Click green "Run workflow" button**

## 📊 Alternative: Manual Trigger URL

Visit this link directly to trigger:
```
https://github.com/ascespade/moeen/actions/workflows/cursor-continuous-fix.yml
```

Then click "Run workflow"

## 🔍 Check Workflow File Syntax

The workflow file might have syntax errors. Common issues:

1. **Missing spaces** in bash scripts
2. **Incorrect indentation** in YAML
3. **Wrong variable references** in GitHub Actions syntax

## 🛠️ Quick Fix Script

Run this to check and fix issues:

```bash
# Check YAML syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/cursor-continuous-fix.yml

# Or if not installed, just view the file
cat .github/workflows/cursor-continuous-fix.yml | head -20
```

## 📝 What the Workflow Does

1. **Runs tests** from `tests/modules` recursively
2. **Analyzes errors** if tests fail
3. **Loops** up to 5 times until all tests pass
4. **Creates PR** with analysis report
5. **Uploads artifacts** with all logs

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Issue 1: "No runs yet"
- **Cause**: Workflow hasn't been triggered
- **Fix**: Click "Run workflow" button

### Issue 2: "Invalid workflow file"
- **Cause**: YAML syntax error
- **Fix**: Check workflow file syntax

### Issue 3: "Permission denied"
- **Cause**: Missing GitHub permissions
- **Fix**: Check repository permissions

### Issue 4: "Workflow not found"
- **Cause**: File not pushed to remote
- **Fix**: Push changes with `git push origin main`

## 🎉 Expected Result

After triggering successfully, you should see:

```
✅ Workflow run started
🔄 Running job: Continuous Fix & Enhance Loop
🧪 Running tests...
📊 Analyzing results...
```
