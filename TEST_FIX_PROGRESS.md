# Test Fix Progress Report

## Current Status
- ✅ Playwright browsers installed
- ✅ Test infrastructure setup (webServer configured)
- ✅ Test files updated to use BASE_URL
- ⚠️ Environment variable validation causing 500 errors instead of proper 401 responses
- ⚠️ Server crashes on API routes due to strict env validation

## Issues Found

1. **Environment Variable Validation Too Strict**
   - `DATABASE_URL` was required but not always needed (using Supabase directly)
   - `JWT_SECRET` validation too strict in development
   - Env validation throws during module load, causing 500 errors

2. **API Routes Returning 500 Instead of 401**
   - Routes crash during initialization due to env validation
   - ErrorHandler catches but returns 500, should return 401 for auth failures

3. **Test Failures**
   - Most tests failing because server returns 500 instead of expected status codes
   - Tests expect 401 for unauthorized, but getting 500 from env errors

## Fixes Applied

1. ✅ Made `DATABASE_URL` optional (Supabase used directly)
2. ✅ Made `JWT_SECRET` have better defaults for development
3. ✅ Updated env validation to be more lenient in development mode
4. ✅ Configured Playwright webServer to auto-start dev server
5. ✅ Updated test files to use BASE_URL consistently

## Remaining Work

1. Fix env validation to not throw during module load
2. Ensure all routes return proper status codes (401 for auth, not 500)
3. Run full test suite and fix remaining failures
4. Add comprehensive test cases for all modified routes
5. Verify 100% test pass rate

## Next Steps
1. Restart server with fixed env validation
2. Run production-security-routes tests
3. Fix any remaining route issues
4. Run full module test suite
5. Iterate until all tests pass
