## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Immediate Usage**

```bash
# Validate workflows
npm run ci:validate

# Test workflows
npm run ci:test

# Generate learning report
npm run ci:learn

# Fix workflow issues
npm run ci:heal
```

### 2. **Manual Workflow Triggers**

1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Ultimate CI Self-Healing Agent"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose parameters and execute

### 3. **Monitoring**

- **Reports**: Check `reports/` directory for detailed analysis
- **Dashboard**: View `dashboard/logs.json` for real-time status
- **Learning**: Run `npm run ci:learn` for system insights

## 🧠 Learning System

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Error tracking and learning
error_logs (id, workflow, error_message, error_hash, error_type, fix_action, success, confidence_score, timestamp)

-- Solution storage
solutions (id, error_hash, solution_type, solution_data, success_count, failure_count, confidence)

-- Performance metrics
performance_metrics (id, workflow, metric_name, metric_value, unit, improvement_percentage)

-- Learning sessions
learning_sessions (id, session_id, errors_analyzed, fixes_applied, success_rate, learning_insights)
```

### Learning Process

1. **Error Detection**: Workflow failures are automatically detected
2. **Pattern Analysis**: System analyzes error patterns and context
3. **Solution Lookup**: Checks database for similar past errors
4. **Fix Generation**: Creates fixes using learned patterns or AI
5. **Application**: Applies fixes and validates results
6. **Learning Update**: Records success/failure for future reference

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
CURSOR_API_KEY=your_cursor_api_key_here
CI_LEARNING_DB_PATH=ci_memory.sqlite
CI_MAX_RETRIES=3
CI_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7
```

### Workflow Parameters

- **mode**: auto, first-run, incremental, emergency, maintenance, cleanup, full-test, rapid-commits
- **scope**: full, frontend, backend, database, tests, security, performance
- **force-full-test**: true/false

## 📈 Performance Features

### Intelligent Testing

- **First Run**: Comprehensive testing for new setups
