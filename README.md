# ðŸ§© Global Integrity & Full Testing Orchestrator

This orchestrator script is responsible for:
1. Verifying results from 3 agents (FrontendCleaner, BackendCleaner, SharedVerifier)
2. Scanning all project files and identifying unused ones
3. Isolating unnecessary files in `.isolated_trash` folder
4. Generating comprehensive tests using Playwright
5. Producing a complete project status report

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Verification**: Coordinates with FrontendCleaner, BackendCleaner, and SharedVerifier agents
- **Unused File Detection**: Scans the entire project and identifies files not referenced by the agents
- **Safe File Isolation**: Moves unused files to timestamped quarantine folders
- **Comprehensive Test Generation**: Creates Playwright tests for frontend, backend, shared utilities, and project integrity
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates JSON reports with cleanup statistics

## Usage

### Run the Orchestrator
```bash
npm run orchestrate
```

### Run Generated Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:frontend
npm run test:backend
npm run test:shared
npm run test:integrity
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (ES modules support)
- Playwright installed (`npm install`)

## Generated Tests

The orchestrator generates the following test suites:

1. **Frontend Tests**: Route loading and component verification
2. **Backend Tests**: API endpoint health checks
3. **Shared Tests**: Utility function validation
4. **Integrity Tests**: Project structure verification

## Reports

The orchestrator generates:
- `cleanup_verification_report.json`: Summary of cleanup operations
- `isolation_log.json`: Detailed log of moved files
- Test execution reports via Playwright

## Safety Features

- Files are moved (not deleted) to quarantine folders
- Timestamped quarantine directories prevent data loss
- Comprehensive logging of all operations
- Safe file handling with proper error checking
