## Steps to Trigger & Monitor

### Step 1: Trigger the Workflow

1. Visit: https://github.com/ascespade/moeen/actions
2. Find: **"🔄 Cursor Continuous Fix & Enhance Loop"**
3. Click: **"Run workflow"** button (top right)
4. Options:
   - Max attempts: 5 (default) or higher
   - Stop on success: ✅ true
5. Click: **Green "Run workflow" button**

### Step 2: Monitor in Real-Time

Once triggered, you'll see:

```
🔄 Starting continuous fix and enhance loop...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔄 Attempt 1 of 5
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🧪 Step 1: Running Playwright tests from tests/modules (recursive)...
```

**Progress indicators:**
- 🧪 Yellow circle = Running
- ✅ Green check = Passed
- ❌ Red X = Failed
- ⏸️ Gray pause = In queue

### Step 3: Check Logs During Run

Click on the running workflow to see:
1. **Real-time logs** - Scroll to see live output
2. **Test results** - Each attempt's results
3. **Analysis reports** - Error categorization
4. **Fix suggestions** - Recommended actions

### Step 4: Review Results After Completion

The workflow will:
1. ✅ Create a new branch: `fix/continuous-{run_id}`
2. 📤 Upload artifacts with all test logs
3. 🔗 Create a PR with comprehensive report

## Monitoring Tips

### Watch for These Patterns

**Good Progress:**
```
✅ Attempt 1: 10 tests failed → Analyze
✅ Attempt 2: 5 tests failed → Analyze
✅ Attempt 3: 2 tests failed → Analyze
✅ Attempt 4: All tests passed! 🎉
```

**Stuck (needs review):**
```
❌ Attempt 1: 10 tests failed
❌ Attempt 2: 10 tests failed (same errors)
❌ Attempt 3: 10 tests failed (same errors)
⚠️ Reached max attempts - manual intervention needed
```

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Test Count**
   - How many tests are running?
   - Is the count consistent?

2. **Failure Rate**
   - Decreasing = Good (fixes working)
   - Stable = Issues persist
   - Increasing = Something broke

3. **Error Types**
   - Multiple types = Complex issues
   - Single type = Easier to fix
   - Type changing = Tests unstable

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Starting
- Check if file exists: `.github/workflows/cursor-continuous-fix.yml`
- Verify it's on main branch
- Refresh GitHub Actions page

### Workflow Stuck
- Check GitHub Actions service status
- Review runner availability
- Cancel and retry if needed

### Tests Never Pass
- Review the analysis report in artifacts
- Check specific failing tests
- May need manual code fixes

## Expected Timeline

- **Setup**: 30-60 seconds
- **Each attempt**: 2-5 minutes
- **Maximum**: 5 attempts × 3 minutes = ~15 minutes
- **Artifact upload**: 1-2 minutes
- **PR creation**: 10-30 seconds

**Total estimated time**: 15-20 minutes for full cycle
