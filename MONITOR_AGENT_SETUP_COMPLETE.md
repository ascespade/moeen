## 🔄 Monitoring Cycle

Each monitoring cycle (5-10 seconds):

1. ✅ Collects comprehensive project metrics
2. ✅ Reads agent configuration
3. ✅ Analyzes all module health
4. ✅ Generates detailed report
5. ✅ Calculates health score
6. ✅ Saves reports and learning data
7. ✅ Updates agent status

---

## 📈 Integration Possibilities

### 1. Dashboard Integration
Display real-time metrics in admin dashboard:
```typescript
// Example: Fetch latest report
const response = await fetch('/monitor/reports/moeen-latest.json');
const metrics = await response.json();
console.log('Health Score:', metrics.project_health.health_score);
```

### 2. CI/CD Integration
Add to GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
- name: Monitor Project Health
  run: npm run monitor:agent
  
- name: Check Health Score
  run: |
    SCORE=$(jq '.project_health.health_score' monitor/reports/moeen-latest.json)
    if [ $SCORE -lt 80 ]; then exit 1; fi
```

### 3. Alerting System
Monitor health score and send alerts:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
npm run monitor:agent
SCORE=$(jq '.project_health.health_score' monitor/reports/moeen-latest.json)
if [ $SCORE -lt 80 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Health score below threshold: $SCORE"
  # Send notification
fi
```
