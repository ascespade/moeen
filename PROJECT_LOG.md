# Moeen Project Log - سجل المشروع

This file tracks automated fixes, improvements, and agent activities.

## 2025-10-31

### Initial Setup
- ✅ Created `.meneen-agent.json` background agent configuration
- ✅ Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-security-tests.yml`)
- ✅ Created `scripts/replace-console.js` for automated console.log replacement
- ✅ Added database constraints migration (`migrations/2025-10-31-add-constraints.sql`)
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suites:
  - `tests/api/permissions.spec.ts` - Role-based access control tests
  - `tests/api/workflows.spec.ts` - Business logic and workflow tests
  - `tests/api/production-security-routes.spec.ts` - Security tests
  - `tests/api/modified-routes-comprehensive.spec.ts` - Route coverage tests

### Environment & Configuration Fixes
- ✅ Fixed environment variable validation in `src/config/env.ts`
  - Made `DATABASE_URL` optional (Supabase used directly)
  - Made `JWT_SECRET` more flexible with development defaults
  - Improved error handling to never throw in development mode

### Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Configured Playwright webServer in `playwright.config.ts`
- ✅ Updated all test files to use `BASE_URL` consistently
- ✅ Improved test error handling and expectations

### Security Improvements
- ✅ All API routes now use `requireAuth()` middleware
- ✅ Centralized error handling with `ErrorHandler`
- ✅ Environment variables accessed through validated `env` config
- ✅ Supabase client standardized (user-scoped vs admin-scoped)

### Next Actions
- [ ] Run full test suite and fix remaining failures
- [ ] Verify all tests pass with new security measures
- [ ] Add more edge case tests
- [ ] Performance optimization pass
- [ ] Documentation updates
