# ü§ñ Enhanced Cursor Manual Workflow Guide

## Overview

This enhanced workflow provides improved error analysis and automatic fix suggestions for Playwright tests. Unlike the original workflow that relied on a non-existent `cursor-agent` CLI, this enhanced version uses smart analysis and creates actionable reports.

## Key Improvements

### ‚úÖ What's Fixed

1. **Removed Non-Existent Dependencies**: No more `cursor-agent` CLI calls
2. **Smart Error Analysis**: Analyzes test logs to identify common issues:
   - Timeout issues
   - Element not found errors
   - Visibility problems
   - API/network errors
   - Assertion failures
3. **Actionable Reports**: Creates JSON reports with specific suggestions
4. **Automatic PR Creation**: Creates PRs with analysis for review

### üéØ Modes

1. **test-only**: Run tests and display results
2. **test-and-fix**: Run tests + analyze failures + create fix report
3. **test-fix-enhance**: Test + analyze + enhance code quality
4. **enhance-only**: Code quality improvements only

## Usage

### Via GitHub Web UI

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **"ü§ñ Cursor Manual Workflow (Enhanced)"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Choose your mode and settings
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

### Via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not installed
# For Windows: Download from https://cli.github.com/

# Test only
gh workflow run "cursor-manual-workflow-enhanced.yml" \
  -f mode="test-only" \
  -f stop_on_success="true"

# Test and fix
gh workflow run "cursor-manual-workflow-enhanced.yml" \
  -f mode="test-and-fix" \
  -f stop_on_success="false" \
  -f model="gpt-4o"

# Full cycle
gh workflow run "cursor-manual-workflow-enhanced.yml" \
  -f mode="test-fix-enhance" \
  -f stop_on_success="false"
```

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Testing
- Checks out code
- Installs dependencies
- Runs Playwright tests
- Captures test output
- Uploads artifacts

### Phase 2: Smart Analysis (if tests fail)
- Downloads test logs
- Analyzes error patterns using regex
- Identifies issue types (timeout, notFound, visibility, api)
- Creates analysis report with suggestions
- Opens PR with findings

### Phase 3: Enhancement (optional)
- Scans for TODO comments
- Provides code quality insights
- Creates enhancement report

### Phase 4: Final Report
- Summary of all phases
- Links to artifacts
- Status of each phase

## Output

### Analysis Report (`analysis-report.json`)

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-XX...",
  "issues": ["timeout", "notFound"],
  "suggestions": [
    "Check selectors and add proper waits",
    "Review locators, add data-testid attributes"
  ]
}
```

### Pull Request

When tests fail, a PR is automatically created with:
- Analysis report
- Suggested fixes
- Link to workflow run
- Test logs as artifacts

## Configuration

No additional secrets required! The workflow uses:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatic)
- Standard Node.js/Playwright setup

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Pass but Workflow Fails
- Check the workflow logs
- Review artifact downloads
- Ensure all paths are correct

### Analysis Not Running
- Verify test logs exist
- Check artifact upload/download
- Review file permissions

### PR Not Created
- Check GitHub token permissions
- Verify branch doesn't already exist
- Review git configuration

## Next Steps

For actual automated fixes, consider:

1. **Integrate with Cursor API** (when available)
2. **Use GitHub Copilot** for code suggestions
3. **Add eslint/prettier** for automatic formatting
4. **Set up pre-commit hooks** for local checks

## Example Output

```
üîç Analyzing test failures...
üìä Found issues: timeout, notFound
‚úÖ Analysis complete

üí° Suggestions:
1. Check selectors and add proper waits
2. Review locators, add data-testid attributes
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **No External Dependencies**: Works out of the box
‚úÖ **Actionable Reports**: Get specific suggestions
‚úÖ **Automatic PRs**: Review findings in GitHub
‚úÖ **Flexible**: Choose your mode
‚úÖ **Reliable**: No CLI dependencies

## Migration from Original

The original workflow failed because:
- `cursor-agent` CLI doesn't exist
- Installation steps failed
- No fallback mechanism

This enhanced version:
- ‚úÖ Uses built-in analysis
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ Provides real value
- ‚úÖ Easy to extend
