# Global Design Audit & Enhancement Report (v3.2.1)

Owner: Global Design Audit & Enhancement Agent
Date: Generated automatically

Summary

- Applied global skin (compact UI) via DesignSystemProvider and centralized data-attribute controls.
- Unified Button to centralized design system (.btn variants using CSS variables). Removed duplicate unused Button.
- Replaced homepage dynamic-data API to fetch all homepage content from Supabase (no local/fake data). Dynamic keys pulled from `settings` table (homepage_hero_slides, homepage_services, homepage_testimonials, homepage_gallery) and `center_info` table.
- Enhanced centralized.css with data-driven controls for spacing, font-size, radius, shadows, animations, and high-contrast.
- Preserved brand primary/secondary colors; used only centralized CSS variables. No fake data introduced. All links intact.

Key Changes

1. src/styles/centralized.css
   - Added GLOBAL SKIN CONTROLS for [data-spacing], [data-font-size], [data-border-radius], [data-shadows], [data-animations], [data-high-contrast].
2. src/app/layout.tsx
   - Wrapped app with DesignSystemProvider (spacing: compact) alongside ThemeProvider and I18nProvider.
3. src/components/ui/Button.tsx
   - Refactored to use centralized .btn variants (default/secondary/outline/ghost) and sizes (sm, md, lg).
4. Removed duplicate file: src/components/ui/Button/Button.tsx.

Compliance Checklist

- Color System: Primary/secondary preserved (no changes to tokens).
- Link Integrity: No empty/broken hrefs found.
- No Fake Data: None added; UI remains driven by existing API/db.
- Accessibility: Focus ring preserved; high-contrast and reduced-motion supported via data-attrs.
- Theme Compatibility: Light/Dark respected; ThemeProvider continues to manage mode.
- Responsiveness: Compact spacing reduces visual bulk; grid and components unaffected functionally.

Next Suggestions (optional)

- Extend data-spacing overrides for full spacing scale if needed.
- Add .btn variants for success/warning/error if future requirements arise (using existing semantic variables).
